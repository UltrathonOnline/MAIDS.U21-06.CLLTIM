    <abstract>
        <question>Please provide a brief abstract describing this dataset.</question>
        <answer>Infections are the leading cause of mortality in CLL. Risk of Infection is increased upon CLL treatment and currently we have no model that is able to predict risk of infection upon CLL treatment. The dataset created puts together various sources of time-series electronic health records on CLL patients in Denmark. This also includes outcome on death, treatment and infection. Using this data set we aim to both model risk of infection upon CLL treatment and uncover risk factors responsible for low immune function and duration of treatment response upon different treatment regimens.</answer>
